		<h2>We Make Games</h2>
		<p>
			We're working on a set of interesting video game concepts. Follow us at the links above to see hints about those as they become available!
			Our primary current title is <b>Voxalia</b>. News for that is posted in the Discord news channel.
			A few minor titles are more quietly also in the works.

		<h2>We Make Software</h2>
		<p>
			We're working on high quality modern style software in general as well! Everything from script engines to data formatting systems.
			It may not sound impressive to the average person, but pieces of software like what we build go together to create amazing applications and video games, like those mentioned to the left.
